Setup
-----
To install the plugin you have to: 
1. copy the filters folder in the plugins folder of roundcube;
2. add "filters" in the plugins section of the roundcube configuration (config/main.inc.php). 

To setup the plugin, make a copy of the file config.inc.php.dist and save it as config.inc.php and make changes according to the directions in the configfile.
If you do not make the required copy, or you do not make any changes in the copy, the script will automaticly create a spamfilter rule with the subject ***SPAM***, decode base64 messages and does a case insensitive search when a filter is being executed.
